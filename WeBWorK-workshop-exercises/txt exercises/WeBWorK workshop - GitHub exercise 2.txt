This file is in the ubc-webwork-workshops repo on GitHub. 

WARNING: everything you put on GitHub in this repo is publicly available

You are going to add files to the ubc-webwork-workshops repo in two ways on GitHub.  

Part A: Create file

1. Click on “Create new file” on the “Code” tab.

2. Name your file.
If you want to create a folder to contain your file, type in “/foldername/filename.pg” after the repo name at the top of the page.  

3. Copy and paste the code of the problem you modified earlier in workshop into the file.  

4. Commit new file to a new branch.
Add a title for your commit (other than the default) if you wish, select “Create new branch” and name your branch <username-exercise-2A>.  Click on “Propose new file”.  

5. Create a pull request.
The next page allows you to create a pull request with one click.  Click on “Create pull request”. 

Facilitators will merge pull requests as they come in.  

6. Delete the branch you created (once merged).  
Go to your pull request (Pull requests tab, “Closed” option) and find the “Delete branch” button. 


Part B: Upload file(s)
[Note that there doesn’t seem to be a good option to create a folder for your file using this tool.  One of the limitations of working on GitHub rather than with a git client].
1. Click on “Upload files” on the “Code” tab.  

2. Add a file or several. 
This method gives you the option to add several files and commit them all at once. 

3. Commit new file(s) to a new branch.
Add a title for your commit (other than the default) if you wish, select “Create new branch” and name your branch <username-exercise-2B>.  Click on “Propose changes”.  

4. Create a pull request.
The next page allows you to create a pull request with one click.  Click on “Create pull request”. 

Facilitators will merge pull requests as they come in.  

5. Delete the branch you created (once merged).  
Go to your pull request (Pull requests tab, “Closed” option) and find the “Delete branch” button.
